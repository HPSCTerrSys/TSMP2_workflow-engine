# Build TSMP2

The TSMP2 ( https://github.com/HPSCTerrSys/TSMP2 ) should be either already compiled (see [ReadMe TSMP2](https://github.com/HPSCTerrSys/TSMP2/blob/master/README.md)) or compiled with the following steps.

```bash
cd ${wfe_dir}/src/TSMP2
./build_tsmp2.sh --icon --eclm --parflow
```

Adjust the components to your purpose.
