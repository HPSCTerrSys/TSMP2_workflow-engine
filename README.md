## Introduction

TSMP2 workflow engine for running simulations. The following examples and descriptions are based on a coupled climate simulation case over the EUR-11 domain, but the underlying idea applies to all types of simulations, such as LES, NWP, real and idealised cases. The workflow is applicable for any model combination within the TSMP2 framework realm.
